        <h4>Clients Business</h4>
        <p> Mrs. Terri Burke is a math teacher at Pleasant Grove High School (PGHS), located in Elk Grove, CA. PGHS offers a wide variety of catalog for students to choose from in order to strengthen and develop future interests. </p>
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently there are no strong applications for allowing teachers to create a fully customizable seating chart where the teacher can add names/nicknames, notes, and input grades into assignments directly. </li>
            <li>One fully functional application to supplement teachers’ daily work routine</li>
        </ul>

                <h3>Scope</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The scope of our project aims to provide a comprehensive seating chart solution to the teachers at Pleasant Grove High School. They are in need of a tool that will provide an easy to use method for keeping track of their classroom.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the main goals of our project will be to create a comprehensive seating chart application that will help address “quality of life” issues in a teacher’s day to day routine. We would like to be able to help teachers in a Kindergarten
                        through High School environment with an on the go mobile application and web application that will organize the classroom arrangement with additional niche features that are not included in existing teaching platforms. By bundling
                        these features into one all-inclusive package, we want to help these teachers complete all of their daily tasks in one easy-to-use program.</li>

        <h2>Two Solutions</h2>
        <hr style="width: 20%">
        <h3>GradeBook Solution</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The solution for the gradebook was to implement a data structure that contained either two-integer or two-character strings. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Each string would be associated with both an assignment and a student name. </li>
                <li>Student names would be sorted alphabetically, and assignments would be sorted numerically, creating a simple yet effective grid format.</li>
                <li>We discerned that this method was the easiest and most familiar for our users, since we expect familiarity with the basic formatting of Microsoft Excel.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The gradebook’s relationship with the seating chart would solve our client’s problem by offering an easier system to input grades, as well as provide an interactive and user-friendly seating chart</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Seating Solution</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For our seating chart solution, we want to create a free-form area where students could be dragged and dropped into place using icon objects.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We chose this method because it is the most user-friendly and efficient for creating seating charts.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>We also opted to provide the user with a host of different features that provide quality of life for the classroom.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Student nicknames (editable names)</li>
                <li>Student note field</li>
                <li>Classroom object creation and orientation (for those that like to use podiums)</li>
                <li>Selectable Daily Assignments with a quick grade option for each student</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

            <p>We have discovered a way to help aid teachers with a unique approach to a comprehensive seating chart system. We have designed it to be fully customizable for any teacher’s needs, and this flexibility is what makes it unique. Being able to
                add custom seating arrangements, assignments, and student names makes for an experience tailored to the user’s demands.</p>
            <li>These are some examples of our seating chart arrangements. As you can see, they are able to be restructured and edited fully by the user.</li>

            <li>This is the example of the class entry screen with all the student names in the class. It allows the teacher to edit names as needed and either add or remove students at will.</li>

        <h1>Lesson's We Learned</h1>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Tools that we learned about as a team throughout this class:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Prototyping Programs (Adobe XD)</li>
                <li>PhP database development and hosting tools (XAMPP) </li>
                <li>How to construct tables in a database and query them(SqL MariaDB)</li>
                <li>How to work with version control and continuous integration (Git and FlyingDonut)</li>
            </ul>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Some helpful future tips for teams, and how we succeeded as a development group:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining constant communication with both team members and your Project Owner is the best way to maintain effective feedback that will guide your development efforts.</li>
                <li>Encourage your teammates and make sure to check in on everyone’s progress and assign more help to areas that are struggling</li>
                <li>Sometimes deadlines are hard to meet, be prepared for unforeseen setbacks, and again communicate to solve them.</li>
                <li>Secure your tools that you want to develop with early on in the project, as coming up with solutions on the fly can prove extremely difficult and may even cripple the project as it develops if some critical incompatibility is found late
                    in development.</li>
