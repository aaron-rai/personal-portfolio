# PersonalPortfolio

This is a personal portfolio website that showcases my projects and skills. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is currently semi responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## Highlights

- **Projects**: Showcases my projects with links to the live version and the source code.
- **Skills**: Lists my technical skills.
- **About**: A short bio about me.
- **Contact**: A contact form to get in touch with me.

## Caveats

- The website is currently semi responsive. It works on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens but could be improved.
- I built this in 2021 and my skills have improved since then. I plan to rebuild this website with my updated skills.
- The current structure of the website is not ideal. I plan to refactor the code to make it more maintainable and scalable.
